My research activity focuses on novel questions and unexplained phenomena in a broad range of physical systems found in nature.  
I am inspired by mathematical problems found in nature and industry, encompassing areas in small-scale fluid mechanics, solid mechanics and elasticity,  
I use a combination of analytical derivations, asymptotic analysis, numerical computations and empirical investigation in  
Spermatozoa swimming, animal and human fertilization. 
swimming of microorganisms, such as bacteria 
Flagella and cilia, self-organization and molecular motor dynamics 
Dynamics of cytoskeletal filaments and filament bundles,  
Cell mechanics and cancer 
Synthetic propellers and bio-inspired swimmers 
Membrane separation processes and transport phenomena  
Pattern formation.  

Main areas include: 
Small-scale and biological fluid mechanics 
Biological soft matter, solid mechanics and elasticity 
Industrial and applied mathematics 
Mathematical Biology 
Statistical mechanics
