		<p class="text-justify">The current "Computer-Aided Semen Analysis" (<abbr title="Computer-Aided Semen Analysis">CASA</abbr>) system used in clinics is a poor predictor of fertility as it only measures head movement, ignoring the flagellum, which s n important, subtle predictor of fertility and sperm health. Thus, semen samples are assessed with little information about the sperm</p>
		<div class="row py-5 text-justify">
			<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
				<p class="alert alert-secondary"><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
				<p>To develop a mathematical tool linking the sperm head motion to that of the flagella. This will allow in-depth analysis of the sperm’s nternal mechanics, providing a practical indicator of sperm viability. This will be combined with cheap technologies to recognize wimming atterns of the most “healthy” sperm.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
				<p class="alert alert-secondary"><strong>Novelty</strong></p>
				<p>We will use mathematical modelling simulations to understand the link between flagellar beat and swimming motion, introducing entirely ew fertility parameters (e.g. sperm energy efficiency).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
				<p class="alert alert-secondary"><strong>Experimental and theoretical approach</strong></p>
				<p>We will feed high spatiotemporal microscope images of the flagellum into a virtual mathematical sperm model to perform simulations of e swimming sperm. From these flagellar movements, swimming pattern can be predicted.</p>
			</div>

				<p class="alert alert-secondary"><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
				<p>We expect applicants to have a degree in Maths, Physics, Computer Science, Engineering or related subjects. We hope the applicant will e interested in interdisciplinary approaches.</p>
