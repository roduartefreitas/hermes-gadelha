				<p>I work in fertile intersects between different branches of mathematical science, biology and industry. My work focuses in understanding unexplained phenomena and their unusual cross-fertilizing connections, encompassing areas in human and animal reproduction, microbial swimming and infection, cellular mechanics, bio-inspired devices and microfluidics (see my research page).</p>

				<p>Following his DPhil in Mathematics at the University of Oxford, I worked as Research Fellow in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, based at Trinity Hall, before going back to Oxford as a Robert Hooke Research Fellow, a post created in honour of Robert Hooke.</p>

				<p>Today, I am a Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at the University of York and Honorary Research Fellow at College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham.</p>
